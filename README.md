## Usage

### REST API

1. Add the `form.token` middleware group to a forms target route

```php
Route::post('form', fn () => 'OK')->middleware('form.token');
```

2. Use one of the corresponding frontend libraries to make form token requests 

### Lighthouse GraphQL API

1. Add the `form.token.handle` middleware to the `lighthouse.route.middleware` config

```php
// config/lighthouse.php â€” must be published

/*
 * Beware that middleware defined here runs before the GraphQL execution phase,
 * make sure to return spec-compliant responses in case an error is thrown.
 */
'middleware' => [
    \Laravel\Sanctum\Http\Middleware\EnsureFrontendRequestsAreStateful::class,

    \Nuwave\Lighthouse\Support\Http\Middleware\AcceptJson::class,

    // Logs in a user if they are authenticated. In contrast to Laravel's 'auth'
    // middleware, this delegates auth and permission checks to the field level.
    \Nuwave\Lighthouse\Support\Http\Middleware\AttemptAuthentication::class,

    // Logs every incoming GraphQL query.
    // \Nuwave\Lighthouse\Support\Http\Middleware\LogGraphQLQueries::class,

    'form.token.handle',
],
```

2. Add the `@requireFormToken` directive to any input that you want to guard against SPAM

```graphql
# e.g. graphql/contact.graphql

input ContactRequestInput @requireFormToken {
    name: String! @rules(apply: ["string", "max:120"])
    email: String! @rules(apply: ["string", "email", "max:254"])
    subject: String! @rules(apply: ["string", "max:78"])
    message: String! @rules(apply: ["string", "max:10000"])
    consent: Boolean! @rules(apply: ["accepted"])
}
```

3. Use one of the corresponding frontend libraries to make form token requests
